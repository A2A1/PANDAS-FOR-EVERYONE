    "The Pandas Series is a one-dimensional container, similar to the built-in Python list. It is the data type that represents each column of the DataFrame. Table 1.1 lists the possible dtypes for Pandas DataFrame columns. Each column in a dataframe must be of the same dtype. Since a dataframe can be thought of a dictionary of Series objects, where each key is the column name and the value is the Series, we can conclude that a Series is very similar to a Python list, except each element must be the same dtype. Those who have used the numpy library will realize this is the same behavior as demonstrated by the ndarray.\n",
